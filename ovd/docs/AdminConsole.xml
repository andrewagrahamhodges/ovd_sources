      As you probably noticed at installation time, the console is
      available using a web browser by entering the following
      URL <ulink>http://ip.or.host/ovd/admin/</ulink> where
      <emphasis>ip.or.host</emphasis> is the name or IP address of the

              maintenance to be sure that no sessions are going to be
