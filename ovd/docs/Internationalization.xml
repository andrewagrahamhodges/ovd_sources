    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>This documentation explains how Ulteo handles internationalization
    and localization in the Open Virtual Desktop solution.</para>

    <para>Ulteo is translated into many languages and is open to support
    translations for other languages.</para>

    <para>Ulteo OVD is a solution to access desktops and applications, the
    client can specify the required language for the session. The various
    operating systems and applications contained within the OVD infrastructure
    also have to support the required language.</para>

    <para>Ulteo OVD supports keyboard mapping between clients and servers.
    Ulteo OVD allows the user to specify the keyboard mapping to be used for a
    given session. Ulteo OVD also supports Unicode IME input.</para>
  </section>

  <section id="translations">
    <title>Ulteo OVD translations</title>

    <para>Two parts of the Ulteo OVD solution are translated: the
    Administration Console and the client software.</para>

    <note>
      <para>The Ulteo OVD translations are provided by the community.</para>

      <para>If your own language is missing in the current Ulteo OVD
      translations and you are motivated to translate solutions, you are very
      welcome to do so. Please contact us at this address:
      <email>translations@ulteo.com</email>.</para>
    </note>

    <section id="translations_admin">
      <title>Administration Console</title>

      <para>The default behavior of the Administration Console is to detect
      the client browser language. But it's also possible to configure the
      language if you prefer: from the <emphasis>Configuration</emphasis>
      page, go into <emphasis>System settings</emphasis> and change the
      <emphasis>Administration Console language</emphasis> option.</para>

      <important id="admin_console_important">
        <para>After setting the language, the console could still be in
        English. That's probably because your Linux server system hosting the
        Session Manager does not support the new language. So you have to add
        the language support and restart the HTTP server.</para>

        <para>Each Linux distribution has his own method to manage language
        support. For instance, on Ubuntu system, there is a
        <emphasis>language-pack-$LANG</emphasis> package to install.</para>
      </important>

      <para>On the technical side, the Session Manager translations are
      provided by the <emphasis>ulteo-ovd-l10n</emphasis> package. This
      package contain both client and Administration Console translations in
      GNU Gettext files.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="translations_web_client">
      <title>Ulteo Web Portal</title>

      <para>When the first connection happens, the Web Portal detects the
      client language from the browser settings. But you can modify it by
      clicking on <emphasis>Advanced Settings</emphasis> and modify the
      <emphasis>Language</emphasis> option. When the option is manually set by
      the user, it is stored into a COOKIE and is re-used to determine the
      selected language for subsequent connections.</para>

      <para>The Web Portal uses the same translation system as the Session
      Manager Administration Console. So please <ulink
      url="#admin_console_important">the Administration Console note</ulink>
      part if you encounter any problem.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="translations_native_client">
      <title>Ulteo Native Client</title>

      <para>When a Native Client starts up, it detects the system language and
      applies the language strings if possible. It is also possible to modify
      the language setting manually by clicking on <emphasis>More
      options</emphasis> and selecting the <emphasis>Language</emphasis>
      option.</para>

      <para>When the option is manually set by the user, the selected language
      is saved into a configuration file to keep your setting for the next
      start of the Native Client. It is also possible to configure the client
      language by editing the setting file.</para>
    </section>

  <section id="aps">
    <title>Application Servers</title>

    <para>You may be interested in starting non-English Ulteo sessions in your
    OVD farm. Either because your users do not speak English or because users
    speak different (various) languages. Of course, it is possible to select a
    language from the Ulteo Client but the Application Server operating system
    must support the selected language.</para>

    <para>By default, both <trademark class="registered">Windows</trademark>
    and Linux provide English language support. Depending on how the system
    was installed, it can support other languages out-of-the-box. Once
    installed, it is still possible to add support for other languages. The
    process for doing so is different between Linux and <trademark
    class="registered">Windows</trademark>.</para>

    <section id="aps_linux">
      <title>Linux</title>

      <para>Linux is a complete multilingual Operating System. The packaging
      system provides translation packs for both system and
      applications.</para>

      <para>The Linux subsystem archive does not support any other language
      than English on a fresh install.</para>

      <important>
         Go into the OVD chroot (if command fails, this means you haven't any chroot) 

        <screen>
        
# uchroot 
      </screen>

         
      </important>

      <para>To install language support, you have to install some additional
      packages.</para>

      <screen>
        
# apt-get install language-pack-$LANG
      </screen>

      <para>To have full language support for all applications, there are some
      other packages to install.</para>

      <screen>
        
# apt-get install language-pack-$LANG \
                  language-support-$LANG \
                  language-pack-gnome-$LANG \
                  language-pack-kde-$LANG \
                  kde-l10n-$LANG \
                  libreoffice-l10n-$LANG

      </title>

      <para>The <trademark class="registered">Microsoft Windows</trademark>
      server 2003 and 2008 are installed in a specific language but
      alternative languages may be installed.</para>

      <para>The process is different from <trademark
      class="registered">Windows</trademark> server 2003 and 2008 (r2) but,
      for both systems, you have to get MUI language packs from <trademark
      class="registered">Microsoft</trademark> website.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The <trademark class="registered">Windows</trademark> 2003
          language packs are installable from a setup program (one for each
          language). So select the language and execute the setup.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>For <trademark class="registered">Windows</trademark> 2008,
          you have to go into the <emphasis>Control Panel</emphasis>, then
          <emphasis>Region and Language</emphasis>, select the
          <emphasis>Keyboards and Languages</emphasis> tab and click on
          <emphasis>Install/Uninstall Language</emphasis>. Then you just have
          to browse to the <emphasis>lp.cab</emphasis> and select it.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <simplesect>
        <title>Applications</title>

        <para>On <trademark class="registered">Microsoft Windows</trademark>,
        each application manages its own internationalization system. Some
        applications can be installed in multilingual mode whereas some others
        support only one language.</para>

        <para>For instance, Microsoft Office includes only one language by
        default afer the installation. But you can add language packs
        separately. The same process is also possible with LibreOffice and
        many other applications.</para>

  <section id="keyboard">
    <title>Keyboards Layouts</title>

    <para>Ulteo supports two type on input method: scancode and
    unicode.</para>

    <section id="keyboard_scancode">
      <title>Scancode</title>

      <para>Scancode is a database where, from each keyboard layout, each
      keyboard key has a different code. So the client sends the keyboard
      layout identifier at session start and transform each keyboard input key
      into a scancode that is sent to the RDP server.</para>

      <para>This method is the default method used in Ulteo OVD.</para>

      <para>The problem of this method is that each client and server have to
      know the specifications of every existing keyboard layout in the world.
      OVD provides a support for the set of the most popular used
      keyboards.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="keyboard_unicode">
      <title>Unicode</title>

      <para>Unicode is an alternative method that sends unicode characters to
      the client instead of keyboard key codes.</para>
    </section>

    <section id="keyboard_choose">
      <title>Choosing the input method and/or the keyboard layout</title>

      <para>By default, on both the Native Client and the Web Portal, the
      scancode method is used and the keyboard layout is auto detected on the
      system. It is possible to specify the settings manually by clicking on
      <emphasis>Advanced Settings</emphasis> and change the <emphasis>Keyboard
      layout</emphasis> option.</para>

      <para>The choosen keyboard layout is stored into the default
      configuration file for the Native Client (default.conf) and into a
      Cookie for the Web Portal.</para>

      <para>If the scancode method doesn't support your own keyboard layout,
      you can try to enable the Unicode input method. To do that, you have to
      set the <emphasis>input-method = unicode</emphasis> option in the
      configuration file for the Native Client configuration. Or uncomment the
      <emphasis>define('RDP_INPUT_METHOD', 'unicode');</emphasis> line into
      the <emphasis>config.inc.php</emphasis> file for the Web Portal.</para>

      <para>As a consequence, you won't see the keyboard layout selection
      option anymore in the client interface.</para>
